# Independent Student Journalism

This is a student-run journalism website that analyzes current events using publicly available information. The goal of the site is to practice responsible journalism, compare multiple viewpoints, and present facts clearly and objectively. 

Currently, the site is prepared for future articles, starting with a first topic about a current event. Each article will include confirmed facts, different accounts, open questions, and a separate analysis section.

## Project Structure
- `index.html` – Homepage
- `style.css` – Stylesheet
- `assets/images/` – Images for future articles
- `article.html` – Template for first topic article

## Purpose
- Learn and practice journalism skills
- Compare information from multiple public sources
- Present facts separately from analysis
- Create a clear, professional website

## Future Plans
- Add first article analyzing a current event
- Include images and properly credit sources
- Expand with multiple articles over time
